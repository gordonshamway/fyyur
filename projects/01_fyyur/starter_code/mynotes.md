# Things that are not clear
- Validators in "New Artist" and "New Venue" do not work, they donÂ´t stop the site from submitting, nor do they show the error!
- Since the new columns of artist and venues are not in the forms, I can not submit them with a new entry

# Open Points
- Show the number of open shows in the future or past with search result - even though - the view does not show them!
